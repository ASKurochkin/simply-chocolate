                    <p class="overlay-description">Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa, sugar
                        and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a
                        beverage in pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United
                        States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin America.</p>

                    <p class="overlay-description">Milk is a white liquid food produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It
                        is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before they
                        are able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains antibodies
                        that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk contains many
                        nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

                        best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to compare it to a different type of
                        chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter
                        taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable flavor of chocolate is very
                        versatile.</p>
